This code trains a logistic regression model to classify text data into positive or negative sentiment.

It uses the NLTK library to preprocess the data by converting it to lowercase, removing punctuation and numbers, tokenizing the text, and removing stop words.
It then uses the sklearn library to convert the text data into numerical features using bag of words and split the data into training and testing sets. 

The training set is used to train the logistic regression model, and the testing set is used to evaluate its performance. The model is saved to disk using the pickle library. The saved model is loaded and used to make predictions on new data, which is preprocessed in the same way as the training data. The number of positive and negative predictions are counted and outputted.
